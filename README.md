# North-American-Roller-Coaster-Lineups
This repository contains code from an analysis I performed into which North American theme parks have the most highly rated roller coasters.

The code above executes a boxplot of North American theme parks by roller coaster rating, and the CSV file contains the raw data.

The full dataset with insights can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D_Zv3-Nb3B8oV7WRe3_G34tWDeAde_rJ8cMSeDN6KpM/edit?usp=sharing
